# Rubiks-Cube-Solver-Bot
Constructed a mechanical manipulator for solving a Rubik’s cube. It is fed the initial state, i.e., the colours on the six faces of the scrambled Rubik’s cube as input through image processing, a solving algorithm is implemented to generate the steps for solving, and the manipulator mechanically solves the cube using Arduino and servo motors.

Tools/Softwares: C++, Python, Arduino IDE, OpenCV
